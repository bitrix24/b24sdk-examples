## Architecture
1. All code run in a docker container.
2. Typical operations described in Makefile

To work with Bitrix24 REST API you **must** create an incoming webhook in your dev-portal with scope `crm`.

## How to work with example

1. Add webhook url in new file `.env.local`
```
BITRIX24_PHP_SDK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-bitrix24-portal-url
```
2. See all available commands in a make file
```shell
make
```
3. Build docker containers
```shell
make docker-build
```
4. Install dependencies from composer
```shell
make composer-install
```

5. Enter into docker container `php-cli` and run example
```shell
make php-cli-bash
php -f src/example.php
```
