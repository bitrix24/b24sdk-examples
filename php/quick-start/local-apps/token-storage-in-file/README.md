# Local Application with Token Storage in File

This example demonstrates a local application for educational purposes.

1. The application **needs to** store the admin token and utilize it.
2. The application **needs to** save application-specific data in a local file.

## Example folder file structure

```plaintext
/assets
    app.css - Stylesheet for the application
/config
    .env - Example environment configuration file
    .env.local - Local environment configuration file (not committed to version control)
    auth.json.local - Authentication data from the application
/public - Directory served by the web server
    /css - Directory for CSS files
    /tmp - Directory for temporary files
    external.php - Page demonstrating the use of stored tokens
    index.php - Main script loaded by default
    install.php - Script for saving the initial OAuth tokens and handling installation steps
/src
    Application.php - Example of a local application
/var
    /log - Directory for log files
        application-YYYY-m-d.log - Application log file
.gitignore - List of files and directories ignored by version control
composer.json - Composer configuration file defining project dependencies and metadata
composer.lock - Automatically generated by Composer to ensure consistent dependency versions
package.json - Configuration file for Node.js dependencies and scripts
tailwind.config.js - Configuration file for Tailwind CSS
```

## Architecture

### Developer configuration for local development on his machine

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Bitrix24 cloud
        A[Bitrix24 Account] 
    end
    
    A[Bitrix24 Portal] <--> B[Ngrok public host
     xxxx.ngrok-free.app]
    B <--> C[Ngrok client]
    
    subgraph Developer Machine 
    C <--> D[PHP dev «web server» 
    host: 127.0.0.1:8080]
    D --> E[PHP Application]
    end
```

### Production configuration

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Bitrix24 cloud
        A[Bitrix24 Account] 
    end
    
    A[Bitrix24 Account] <--> B[web-server]
    
    subgraph Production server 
    B[web-server] --> E[PHP-fpm Application]
    end
```

## Installation and running

### Installation of SDK

1. Open shell and go to folder `/php/quick-start/local-apps/token-storagein-file/`
2. Install dependencies via composer

```shell
composer install
```

3. Open package.json and run command "dev"

This command will start the PHP web server, the ngrok client, and the Tailwind CSS run-time. The PHP web server will serve your application locally, the ngrok client will expose your local server to the internet, and the Tailwind CSS run-time will process your CSS files. For more information, you can refer to the following documentation:

- [PHP Built-in Web Server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

> [!WARNING]  
> This web server is intended for application development and testing purposes only. It may also be useful for controlled environment demonstrations. It is not designed to be a full-featured web server.

To check if the PHP web server is started, open another terminal tab or window and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your web browser. If the server is running, you should see your application or a directory listing.

To check if the ngrok client is started, open another terminal tab or window and navigate to the URL provided by ngrok in your web browser. The URL will look something like `http://<random-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app`. If ngrok is running, you should see your application.

The ngrok client output in the terminal will look something like this:

```plaintext
Session Status                online
Account                       YourAccount (Plan: Free)
Update                        update available (version 3.16.0, Ctrl-U to update)
Version                       3.10.0
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       196ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://<random-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app -> http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

4. Open the ngrok local web interface at [http://127.0.0.1:4040/](http://127.0.0.1:4040/) to view the latest requests.
5. Navigate to your Bitrix24 portal, go to the left menu, select "Developer resources," then "Other," and finally "Local application."
6. Choose the "server" type of application.
7. In the "handler path" field, enter your forwarding address: `https://<random-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/index.php`.
8. In the "Initial installation path" field, enter your forwarding address: `https://<random-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/install.php`.
9. Assign the necessary permissions and add the scope: `user_brief`.
10. Click the "Save" button, then click the "reinstall" button.
11. You should see:
    - A POST request to `https://<random-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/install.php` in the ngrok web interface at [http://127.0.0.1:4040/](http://127.0.0.1:4040/).
    - Detailed data in the application log located in the `var/log/application-*.log` folder.
    - The stored admin auth token in the `config/auth.json.local` file.
12. Go to the `config` folder and make a copy of the `.env` file:

```shell
cp .env .env.local
```

13. Open the `.env.local` file and copy the secret data from your Bitrix24 local application settings:
    - `Application ID (client_id)` to `BITRIX24_PHP_SDK_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID`
    - `Application key (client_secret)` to `BITRIX24_PHP_SDK_APPLICATION_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `Assign permissions` (scope) to `BITRIX24_PHP_SDK_APPLICATION_SCOPE`

Your file should look like this example:

```plaintext
BITRIX24_PHP_SDK_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID='YOUR_DATA_HERE'
BITRIX24_PHP_SDK_APPLICATION_CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_DATA_HERE'
BITRIX24_PHP_SDK_APPLICATION_SCOPE='crm,user_brief'
```

14. Now that the application data and admin token are stored, you can make requests to the Bitrix24 REST API. Open `https://<random-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/external.php` in your browser to see your Bitrix24 user data.
